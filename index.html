                    My name is Wes, and I am a software developer with a love
                    for game development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I got sick of making boring command line programs and
                    decided to level up my skills by learning about graphical
                    libraries. Over time, I've tried my hand at a bunch of
                    different game engines using various languages and scripting
                    techniques.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the things I'm most proud of is this 3D online
                    multiplayer chess game I made all by myself. I even designed
                    all the assets using Blender. It was a ton of work, but I
                    still remember the satisfaction and excitement I felt when I
                    had it working.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I love the creative freedom that software development
                    offers. Sure, it can be frustrating when something doesn't
                    work correctly, but there's nothing like the feeling of
                    making a small win that eventually adds up to something
                    amazing.

                  As a Hardware Integration Expert, I build custom PC systems
                  and ensure compatibility between all components. The
                  configuration is tailored to the exact requirements of the
                  intended purpose to optimize the tradeoffs between
                  performance, cost, and use case.

                  It's not always as simple as putting all of the pieces
                  together. A motherboard can be compatible with a CPU but
                  without the correct BIOS, nothing happens! If you don't take
                  care of the pins when you plug something in, they can become
                  smashed and unusable.

                During part of my time at Mount Hood Community College, I was a
                math tutor at the Learning Success Center (LSC). My method of
                tutoring depends highly on the socratic method. That is, the
                student and mentor share a dialogue. The Mentor typically leads
                by asking questions rather than giving answers, and the student
                is also free to ask questions in an open discussion format.
              </p>
              <p>
                This method is particularly important because it stresses a
                level of engagement from the student. The student cannot be
                passive in this exercise, or there is a breakdown in
                communication.
              </p>

                I taught: algebra, trigonometry, precalculus, differential and
                integral calculus.

              The first graphical game I made was pong. Unfortunately, this was
              before I knew how to use GitHub for project hosting, and I seem to
              have lost the files. Fortunately, it was a great learning
              experience. I remade the game for you to enjoy here in the
              browser!

              'Ai Warfare' to enable control using W and S keys on the left
              paddle. Enable the UI Slider on mobile devices.

                This is a term project for my rust class which uses bevy as the
                game engine. It is a game about learning the recipes to combine
                items into new items.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some sample recipes are show below. You can use an axe to kill a
                chicken, or build a fishing pole from a stick, hook, and rope!
              </p>

              <p>
                Bevy game engine utilizes a widely adopted programming paradigm
                prevalent in the context of world generation. It is known as ECS
                which stands for Entity Component System.
              </p>
              <p>
                Entities represent instances that store the games data. For
                example, an Inventory displayed on the screen is an Entity,
                visible on the World Inspector. Each Entity has Components which
                hold information. In our game, Inventory Items need a Component
                that has information about the item name, description, and image
                path, as well as a clickable button.
              </p>
              <p>
                Entities are acted on by systems. This can happen either one
                time at startup, or every frame of the game. These systems
                usually rely on querying for Entities, Components, and
                Resources.
              </p>

              <p>
                Systems can emit or recieve events. This is beneficial because
                it allows the systems to be connected only through the event.
                This is a good connection type because it allows us to decouple
                the systems from one another.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some inventory items have a Timing Component. This allows things
                like chickens to make eggs on a randomized timer. Or raw chicken
                meat to turn to rotten chicken meat if you don't use it!
              </p>
              <p>
                The game inspector plugin also allows us to make modifications
                to the game while it is running and observe the effects. This
                can be useful for debugging.
              </p>
              <p>
                I don't claim to be an artist, but making your own assets feels
                rewarding, and I'm proud to say I made all of these assets
                myself.

              <p>
                This is a project that I did about a year ago. It uses Unity as
                the game engine with C#, and uses PUN (Photon Engine) to
                implement the multiplayer aspect. This project happened over the
                course of a few months. The assets were created in Blender.
              </p>
              <p>
                The images below showing the blue and red tiles are checking for
                collision and movement. This is a very rudimentary solution and
                certainly not the most elegant, but it worked.

              <p>
                This is an ongoing project using the Unity engine. It consists
                of 3d game pieces on a 2d hexagonal grid. The goal is to protect
                your king and destroy the opposing team's king.
              </p>
              <p>
                The multiplayer aspect of this project uses Mirror networking
                and a FizzySteamworks plugin, allowing you to have lobby powered
                by Steam servers.
              </p>
              <p>
                It includes a level builder to allow user generated levels to
                share with your friends, and allows adjustable keybinds. Each
                piece has a unique sound when attacking, and there are other
                sound-effects such as background music and win/loss sounds
              </p>
              <p>
                The game has a fog-of-war mechanic and pieces can see different
                distances and some pieces have a particularly unique attack
                pattern.
