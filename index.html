                        <h1>Nice to meet you!</h1> 
                        <p>My name is Wes, a software developer with a love for game development. I got sick of making boring command line programs and decided to level up my skills by learning about graphical libraries. That's when I discovered the SDL library for C++ which allowed me to make simple games. Over time, I've tried my hand at a bunch of different game engines using all sorts of languages and scripting techniques. I've used Unity (C#), Godot (GDScript), Bevy (Rust), and GameMaker Language (GML) to name a few.
                            One of the things I'm most proud of is this 3D online multiplayer chess game I made all by myself. I even designed all the assets using Blender. It was a ton of work, but I still remember the satisfaction and excitement I felt when I had it working. I love the creative freedom that software development offers. Sure, it can be frustrating when something doesn't work correctly, but there's nothing like the feeling of making a small win that eventually adds up to something amazing. </p>

        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <h2>In the beginning... </h2>
        <p>The first graphical game I made was pong, and the inspiration behind the page logo. Unfortunately, this was before I knew how to use github to host my projects, and I seem to have lost the files. This was still a great learning experience. </p>
        <h2>The Travelling Salesman</h2>
        <p>This is a term project for my rust class which uses bevy as the game engine. It is a game about learning the recipes to combine items into new items. It is still a work in progress!</p>
        <h2>3D Multiplayer Chess</h2>
        <p>This is a project that I did for my own learning, completely separate from my school work. It uses Unity as the game engine with C#, and uses PUN (Photon Engine) to implement the multiplayer aspect. This project happened over the course of a few months, involving creating the assets using Blender. </p>
