Initial repo and files commited. used default html boilerplate.
Site was sucessfully deployed and content is visible.
Spent some time thinking about how the site should be laid out structurally
what contents should be in each section.
Also thought about what specific styles the website should use
and have a simple minimal and clean theme with a little color to pop.
Created simple pong logo, 100x50.
Switched to using bootstrap for easier responsiveness.
