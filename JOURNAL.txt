Initial repo and files commited. used default html boilerplate.
Site was sucessfully deployed and content is visible.
Spent some time thinking about how the site should be laid out structurally
what contents should be in each section.
Also thought about what specific styles the website should use
and have a simple minimal and clean theme with a little color to pop.
Created simple pong logo, 100x50.
Switched to using bootstrap for easier responsiveness.

Added window event listener to pong.js to stop the default behavior on space bar press
It would scroll you down the screen, but I want to use spacebar to start the pong game.
I wanted to make the pong game accessible to mobile phones after my disappointment in using 
it on my own mobile device.
Used another p5 library extension to add GUI slider to the pong game.
Early in making the pong game, i noticed I could decide not to draw the background
which results in really interesting look. So, I added this as a user option checkbox.
Added more user options: Toggle perfect AI, and toggle Slider UI.
Used lighthouse to determine WEBP images are better than PNG for compression.
Used lighthouse to determine that 'defer' is useful for loading scripts after the page
Put most section contents inside of containers with rows and cols for cleaner look.
